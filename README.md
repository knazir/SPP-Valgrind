# SPP-Valgrind
This is a modified version of Valgrind used to trace program execution for
[See++](https://seepluspl.us). It is based off of modifications by Philip Guo
used in [OnlinePythonTutor](https://github.com/pgbovine/OnlinePythonTutor).

For a list of contributors to See++, please see the linked repo above.

Thanks to [Michael Chang](https://github.com/seally1186) for his help.
